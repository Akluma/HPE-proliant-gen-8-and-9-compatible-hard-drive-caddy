# HPE-gen-8-and-9-compatible-hard-drive-caddy

* Easy to print and assembly disk caddy for gen8 and 9 HPE proliant. It replaces 727695-001, so anywhere where is this caddy it will fit.

# Printing
* I love organic supports but in this case, the grid works best. The design is with cost in mind, so the whole caddy is only around 10g. I have made the side rails a lot lower in comparison to the original caddy. The caddy is a bit harder to put in, but for saving around 25g of filament I guess it's worth it :3

>[!NOTE]
>For printing the lock [see here!](main%20body_V1/lock.stl) don't use stiff filament. Use slightly flexible filament such as PLA or PETG. 

# How to assemble
* For assembly, you will need all 3D printed parts [see here!](main%20body_V1). You will also need 2.4mm zip tie and a piece filament of the same material as the printed body.

>[!NOTE]
>You can skip this part you just lose the springing effect of the pull out lever.

* For assembly of the "zip tie spring" you will need a 2.4mm zip tie as mentioned above.

>[!CAUTION]
>The rippled side of the zip tie needs to face the other side than the bends are!


* Now you just insert the bend parts of the zip tie into preprinted retest of the leaver [see here!](main%20body_V1/leaver.stl). After that you just bend the leaver and tread a piece of filament through the hole. You can take and slide the lock [see here!](main%20body_V1/lock.stl) into the resist and tread two pieces of filament through it. After, you just put the upper part [see here!](main%20body_V1/upper%20body.stl) on all of them. It can be a bit finicky if the filament isn't perfectly straight.

Now you trim the filament about 1mm from the part. After that, you take soldering iron with a flat pit and melt the ends.

>[!CAUTION]
>Be aware that doing this is going to ruin your soldering tip! So use already old one or already ruined by previous plastic melting. Take care to clean all remaining solder from the tip before using it.

* The last part is optional. I would recommend it, but maybe you will be fine without it. Now you just melt the side and the back portion of mating point of "main body" [see here!](main%20body_V1/main%20body.stl) and "upper body" [see here!](main%20body_V1/upper%20body.stl)

>[!NOTE]
>The caddy is a bit flimsy until you put a 2.5 drive into it. So for that reason i don't recommend putting empty caddy into a server.
