# HPE-gen-8-and-9-compatible-hard-drive-caddy

* Easy to print and assembly disk caddy for gen8 and 9 HPE proliant. (Possible 10, 11 and 12. But i can not guarantee compatibility because i dont have access to anythink else than 8 and 9 gen.)

# Printing
* I love organic support but in this case the grid works best in tihs case. The design is with cost in mind so whole caddy is only around 10g.

# How to assembly
* For assembly, you will need all 3D printed parts [see here!](main%20body_V1). You will also need 2.4mm zip tie and a piece filament of same material as the printed body.

* For assembly of the "zip tie spring" you wiil need a 2.4mm ziptie as mention above.

>[!CAUTION]
>The rippled side of zip tie need to face other side than the bends are!

* Now you just insert the bend parts  of the zip tie into preprinted resest of the leaver [see here!](main%20body_V1/leaver.stl). After that you just bend the leaver and tread piece of filament throw the hole. You can take and slide the lock [see here!](main%20body_V1/lock.stl) into the resest and tread two pieces of filament trow it. After the you just put the upper part [see here!](main%20body_V1/upper%20body.stl) on all of the. It can be bit finicky if the filament isnt perfectly straight.

Now you trim the filament about 1mm from the part. After that you take soldering iron with flat pit and melt the ends.

>[!CAUTION]
>Be aware that doing this is going to ruin your soldering tip! So use already old one or already ruind by previus plastic melting. Take care to clean all remaining solder from the tip before useing it.

* Last part is option. I would recomend it but maybe you will be fine with out it. Now you just melt the side and the back portion of mateing point of "main body" [see here!](main%20body_V1/main%20body.stl) and "upper body" [see here!](main%20body_V1/upper%20body.stl)

>[!NOTE]
>The caddy is bit flimsy until you put a 2.5 drive into it. So for that reason i don't recommend to put empty caddys into a server.
